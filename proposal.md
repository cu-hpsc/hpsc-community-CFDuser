## Software: SCOREC-core

SCOREC-core is a combination of RPI's research tools to create a finite element mesh and problem domain in parallel. Although there are a number of other uses, users of PHASTA these tools to create the nesissary files for the executable to run. In current research, there is a need to visualize and alter the geometry, while running on large rescources, and map the solution to that new modified domain. I have heard a need to document the functions and what exactally they do.

### Notes/concerns/risks

I have used a bunch of these tools, sometimes nearly mindlessly,
but I have connections to the developers of the tools. 
I have attempted to install, and run the test suite, but have not successfully 
fully created executables on my own. This should be remidied within the next few 
days so that I can run a case for a co-PI on SUMMIT in the next few days....Looks like
I found good documentation about it just now at: https://github.com/SCOREC/core/wiki/Building-and-Running-on-Stampede-Intel-Phi
